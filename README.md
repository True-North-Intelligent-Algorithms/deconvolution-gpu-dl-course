Exploring the Intersection of Deconvolution, GPU Computing, and Deep Learning

## Introduction

This course explores both classical deconvolution and AI approaches to image restoration and how GPU computing is used for both. 

## Outline

* the basics of deconvoluton 
* how to use GPUs for deconvolution
* how to train deep neural networks for image restoration
