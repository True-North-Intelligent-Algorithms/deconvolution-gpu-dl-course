# Introduction to Data Wrangling 

## What is data Wrangling??
[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)

Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. A data wrangler is a person who performs these transformation operations.

In this class we will use Pandas for "Data Wrangling" 

## Why Pandas??

Pandas is a python library.  It allows us to manipulate data programatically.  Then we can apply other tool sets (like the plotting library matplotlib or the machine learning libary scikitlearn) downstream.

## Data Wrangling operations we will learn

* Read .csv, text and excel files
* Use Groupby to summarize data
* Sort data
* Clean data
* Eliminate un-needed or redundant data
* Join, Merge and Concatenate data
